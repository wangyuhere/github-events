It also contains some examples of Canvas drawing techniques to create particle systems, waves and grain effect. I was not really happy with the default shadows in android beacuse they start misbehaving when they are rotated som I made my own shadow solution. Don't expect to much from this lib, it was written as a quick prototype, so the visuals look good but the code behind it could have been better structured. I haven't tested the code in over a year since I have not been working with Android development for the last year.
